# Conditional statements in Python
# Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
# The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.

# Syntax of conditional statements:
# if condition1:
#     # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true

i=5
if i==10:
    print("i is 10")

# elif condition2:
#     # block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
elif i>10:
    print("i is greater than 10")

# else:
#     # block of code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
else:
    print("i is less than 10")
